# Interview Preparation Journey
I have decided to document my journey while I prepare for interviews.  I enlisted IK as my help, and among the instructors, I found Mr. Omkar Deshpande's teaching most helpful. I have gone thru his classes in Sorting, Recursion, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming and plan to continue his supplementary classes as well.
