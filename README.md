# Interview Preparation Journey
I have decided to document my journey while I prepare for interviews.  I enlisted IK as my help, and among the instructors, I found Mr. Omkar Deshpande's teaching most helpful. 

I have gone thru his classes in Sorting, Recursion, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming and plan to continue his supplementary classes as well. Among these lessons, I have documented my practice of the following count of Leetcode problems thus far. My code snipets are written in Javascript, and tested on NodeJS v16.

Total: 63 (09/09/22) => 
- Easy: 3+2+1+1+5+5 (09/09/22)
- Medium: 2+5+8+10+1+1+13 (09/09/22)
- Hard: 2+1+1+1+1 (09/09/22)
