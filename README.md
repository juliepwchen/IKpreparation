# Interview Preparation Journey
I have decided to document my journey while I prepare for interviews.  I enlisted IK as my help, and among the instructors, I found Mr. Omkar Deshpande's teaching most helpful. 

## Algorithms & DS- /algos

As of 09/09/2022, I have gone thru Mr. Omkar's Foundation & Live Cslasses in Sorting, Recursion, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming (Foundation Only) and a couple of Array Floaters classes.  I have code up Leetcode problems from his lesssons and plan to continue proacticing them to improve coding speed.  I find it motivating to make progress and continue to add numbers of problems to my repertoire of knowledge.

As of 09/30/2022, I have added 9 more LC problem from Mr. Omkar's Array Floater class. 

## Algorithms & DS- /mockinterviews

As of 09/30/2022, I have also added /mockinterviews folder where I upload questionnaire from IK Mockinterviewers who are current or ex FAANG engineers.  I found it helpfult to share this information with Peers to dismistify the Mock Interview experience.  Each Mock Interviewer has his/her individual temperament of conducting their interviews, similer to the real-world experience. IK may help to predicting the type of questionnaire using certain problem-solving strategies and patterns, but we cannot expect anyone to predict human personalities and bias.  Just try our best in this process and don't be too hard on ourselvies. 

## Total LC problem count

(09/30/22) => 72
- Easy: 3+2+1+1+5+5 (09/09/22) +2 (09/30)
- Medium: 2+5+8+10+1+1+13 (09/09/22) + 7 (09/30)
- Hard: 2+1+1+1+1 (09/09/22)
